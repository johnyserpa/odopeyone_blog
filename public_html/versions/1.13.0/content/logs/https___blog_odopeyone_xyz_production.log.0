This means having a worldwide cross-borders &quot;single source of trust&quot; where all the processes of whichever business can talk to and trust its information. It was also grasped why the big tech players, such as <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/\">IBM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/\">Oracle</a>, are into R&amp;D and counseling blockchain business integrations, because they will facilitate any kind of business to integrate a blockchain just as they made it possible to any business have a pay-as-you-go cloud infrastructure.<br>\nThey are the state-of-the-art guys, and they will make money helping others developing this tech.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/DOgiqBXXkAIpAxM.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter by @futurebehind\"><em>from @futurebehind twitter</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandogutierrez/\">Fernando Gutierrez</a> from DASH core team was also there and showed us, or at least me, that Bitcoin is probably the MVP of cryptocurrencies, letting <a href=\"https://www.dash.org/\">DASH</a> lead for the best crypto in ease of use for programmers and non-tech users and distributing the incentives way better through the network.<br>\nHe also mentioned three things I hadn't heard of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dash.org/masternodes2/\">Masternodes</a>, that need to have 1000DASH as collateral and facilitate features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend, that are what the name says they are;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/worlds-first-dapi-decentralized-application-programming-interface\">DAPI</a>, which is a decentralized API that facilitates other applications querying the blockchain without having to go directly to it, but talking with a subset, randomly picked, of masternodes in which they know, mathematically, they can trust.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dashpay/dash-roadmap\">DASH DRIVE</a>, which lets you save and query decentralized user object data, outside the blockchain. It is using the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System Protocol) that gives content addresses to data, instead of location addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Don't rely on government to protect you. On Internet and Blockchain, you are alone.&quot; - Fernando Gutierrez</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fernando participated in the next forum, regarding the legalization of Blockchain, and what I really enjoyed he said was &quot;Don't rely on government to protect you. In Internet and Blockchain, you are alone.&quot;, just like in life, you are born and die alone, just you.<br>\nDon't get that normal feeling that government will always (or never) have your back because this is a very difficult to regulate and keep track of technology. Governments are always a step behind the markets, never the other way around.</p>\n<p>I think it will be inevitable that governments unleash the markets. Another way, it will always be a cat and dog run. Long live guys like Henry Thoreau that knew this from the beginning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/DOn0r-dW4AA6Shc.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter by @futurebehind\"><em>from @futurebehind twitter</em></p>\n<p>Another interesting topic was ICO's and the speakers, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/denissuslov/\">Denis Suslov</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulotrezentos/\">Paulo Rodrigo Trezentos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nuno-correia-659175151/\">Nuno Correia</a>, gave their advice on how to spot a good or bad ICO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do they have a team responsible for legal terms?</li>\n<li>Which role does the token play in the project?</li>\n<li>Read the white paper (protocol) and the crowd sale document (roadmap) carefully!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose wisely, as more than 90% of them don't even take off.<br>\nImportant to mention that despite all the unregulated gray area that lays around ICO's and cryptocurrencies, they advised not to fear it, to follow the existing rules, like hiring through the normal system, and most important, <strong>pay taxes</strong>. That's what governments want - if you do it, most of the times you'll be fine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Keep complexity off-chain. Only validate it in-chain&quot; - Gonçalo Sá</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnsps/\">Gonçalo Sá</a> gave a talk about the power of smart contracts.<br>\nWhile talking about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)\">DAO</a>, he mentioned that it was an ultra-complex pile of code all bundled together, comparing it with the <strong>ethereum mindset of smart contracts, making them the smallest unit in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization</strong>. That's evolution, breaking down a pile of code into its atomic units.<br>\nAnother important remark was the fact that smart contracts should not be complex, but rather simple pieces of code that validate the external complex code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ender/\">Anderson Mccutheon</a> talked about the decentralized web and attention span.<br>\nHe spoke about the concept of content and attention monetization as all companies are fighting for it as their core income source. More attention equals more user data that can be sold. <a href=\"http://www.synereo.com/\">Synereo</a> and <a href=\"https://wildspark.me/\">WildSpark</a> are two of his projects that will attempt to break the status quo.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Stop asking for permission!&quot; - Graham de Barra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/B5A8E.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.grupoescolar.com\"><em>from grupoescolar.com</em></p>\n<p>There were a few more talks, but this last guy, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/graham-de-barra-81613a24/\">Graham de Barra</a>, caught all my attention when he mixed all these tech topics with philosophy and history.<br>\nThe conference was in the &quot;Câmara de Comércio de Lisboa&quot;, a beautiful structure with all these magnificent paintings of old Portuguese kings.<br>\nHe made us realize that these guys were the ones that were not giving us freedom of choice, and compared blockchain with the carnations in the 25th of April of 1974 Portuguese revolution, where instead of using bullets to fight the oppressor regime, we put flowers in the tip of the army's guns.<br>\nBlockchain will give us freedom of choice, freedom of doing what we want and not having to ask for permission.<br>\nGraham is the CEO of  <a href=\"http://operaincubator.com/\">Opera Incubator</a>, based in Ireland. Mainly addressed <a href=\"http://festy.ie/\">festy</a>, a new way of paying in closed places, such as festivals or events.<br>\nThis is the beginning of cryptocurrencies payments, and festy will disrupt part of the status quo.</p>\n<p>I hope I can work with any of these guy in the future. Until then, I can only assure myself that I will keep working!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Justin Wu and the organization.</p>\n<p>For reference, I'll just leave here the most important concepts,

This means having a worldwide cross-borders &quot;single source of trust&quot; where all the processes of whichever business can talk to and trust its information. It was also grasped why the big tech players, such as <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/\">IBM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/\">Oracle</a>, are into R&amp;D and counseling blockchain business integrations, because they will facilitate any kind of business to integrate a blockchain just as they made it possible to any business have a pay-as-you-go cloud infrastructure.<br>\nThey are the state-of-the-art guys, and they will make money helping others developing this tech.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/DOgiqBXXkAIpAxM.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter by @futurebehind\"><em>from @futurebehind twitter</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandogutierrez/\">Fernando Gutierrez</a> from DASH core team was also there and showed us, or at least me, that Bitcoin is probably the MVP of cryptocurrencies, letting <a href=\"https://www.dash.org/\">DASH</a> lead for the best crypto in ease of use for programmers and non-tech users and distributing the incentives way better through the network.<br>\nHe also mentioned three things I hadn't heard of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dash.org/masternodes2/\">Masternodes</a>, that need to have 1000DASH as collateral and facilitate features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend, that are what the name says they are;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/worlds-first-dapi-decentralized-application-programming-interface\">DAPI</a>, which is a decentralized API that facilitates other applications querying the blockchain without having to go directly to it, but talking with a subset, randomly picked, of masternodes in which they know, mathematically, they can trust.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dashpay/dash-roadmap\">DASH DRIVE</a>, which lets you save and query decentralized user object data, outside the blockchain. It is using the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System Protocol) that gives content addresses to data, instead of location addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Don't rely on government to protect you. On Internet and Blockchain, you are alone.&quot; - Fernando Gutierrez</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fernando participated in the next forum, regarding the legalization of Blockchain, and what I really enjoyed he said was &quot;Don't rely on government to protect you. In Internet and Blockchain, you are alone.&quot;, just like in life, you are born and die alone, just you.<br>\nDon't get that normal feeling that government will always (or never) have your back because this is a very difficult to regulate and keep track of technology. Governments are always a step behind the markets, never the other way around.</p>\n<p>I think it will be inevitable that governments unleash the markets. Another way, it will always be a cat and dog run. Long live guys like Henry Thoreau that knew this from the beginning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/DOn0r-dW4AA6Shc.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter by @futurebehind\"><em>from @futurebehind twitter</em></p>\n<p>Another interesting topic was ICO's and the speakers, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/denissuslov/\">Denis Suslov</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulotrezentos/\">Paulo Rodrigo Trezentos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nuno-correia-659175151/\">Nuno Correia</a>, gave their advice on how to spot a good or bad ICO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do they have a team responsible for legal terms?</li>\n<li>Which role does the token play in the project?</li>\n<li>Read the white paper (protocol) and the crowd sale document (roadmap) carefully!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choose wisely, as more than 90% of them don't even take off.<br>\nImportant to mention that despite all the unregulated gray area that lays around ICO's and cryptocurrencies, they advised not to fear it, to follow the existing rules, like hiring through the normal system, and most important, <strong>pay taxes</strong>. That's what governments want - if you do it, most of the times you'll be fine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Keep complexity off-chain. Only validate it in-chain&quot; - Gonçalo Sá</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnsps/\">Gonçalo Sá</a> gave a talk about the power of smart contracts.<br>\nWhile talking about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)\">DAO</a>, he mentioned that it was an ultra-complex pile of code all bundled together, comparing it with the <strong>ethereum mindset of smart contracts, making them the smallest unit in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization</strong>. That's evolution, breaking down a pile of code into its atomic units.<br>\nAnother important remark was the fact that smart contracts should not be complex, but rather simple pieces of code that validate the external complex code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ender/\">Anderson Mccutheon</a> talked about the decentralized web and attention span.<br>\nHe spoke about the concept of content and attention monetization as all companies are fighting for it as their core income source. More attention equals more user data that can be sold. <a href=\"http://www.synereo.com/\">Synereo</a> and <a href=\"https://wildspark.me/\">WildSpark</a> are two of his projects that will attempt to break the status quo.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Stop asking for permission!&quot; - Graham de Barra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/B5A8E.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.grupoescolar.com\"><em>from grupoescolar.com</em></p>\n<p>There were a few more talks, but this last guy, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/graham-de-barra-81613a24/\">Graham de Barra</a>, caught all my attention when he mixed all these tech topics with philosophy and history.<br>\nThe conference was in the &quot;Câmara de Comércio de Lisboa&quot;, a beautiful structure with all these magnificent paintings of old Portuguese kings.<br>\nHe made us realize that these guys were the ones that were not giving us freedom of choice, and compared blockchain with the carnations in the 25th of April of 1974 Portuguese revolution, where instead of using bullets to fight the oppressor regime, we put flowers in the tip of the army's guns.<br>\nBlockchain will give us freedom of choice, freedom of doing what we want and not having to ask for permission.<br>\nGraham is the CEO of  <a href=\"http://operaincubator.com/\">Opera Incubator</a>, based in Ireland. Mainly addressed <a href=\"http://festy.ie/\">festy</a>, a new way of paying in closed places, such as festivals or events.<br>\nThis is the beginning of cryptocurrencies payments, and festy will disrupt part of the status quo.</p>\n<p>I hope I can work with any of these guy in the future. Until then, I can only assure myself that I will keep working!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Justin Wu and the organization.</p>\n<p>For reference, I'll just leave here the most important concepts,
