Only validate it in-chain&quot; - Gonçalo Sá</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnsps/\">Gonçalo Sá</a> gave a talk about the power of smart contracts.<br>\nWhile talking about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)\">DAO</a>, he mentioned that it was an ultra-complex pile of code all bundled together, comparing it with the <strong>ethereum mindset of smart contracts, making them the smallest unit in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization</strong>. That's evolution, breaking down a pile of code into its atomic units.<br>\nAnother important remark was the fact that smart contracts should not be complex, but rather simple pieces of code that validate the external complex code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ender/\">Anderson Mccutheon</a> talked about the decentralized web and attention span.<br>\nHe spoke about the concept of content and attention monetization as all companies are fighting for it as their core income source. More attention equals more user data that can be sold. <a href=\"http://www.synereo.com/\">Synereo</a> and <a href=\"https://wildspark.me/\">WildSpark</a> are two of his projects that will attempt to break the status quo.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Stop asking for permission!&quot; - Graham de Barra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/11/B5A8E.jpg\" alt=\"http://www.grupoescolar.com\"><em>from grupoescolar.com</em></p>\n<p>There were a few more talks, but this last guy, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/graham-de-barra-81613a24/\">Graham de Barra</a>, caught all my attention when he mixed all these tech topics with philosophy and history.<br>\nThe conference was in the &quot;Câmara de Comércio de Lisboa&quot;, a beautiful structure with all these magnificent paintings of old Portuguese kings.<br>\nHe made us realize that these guys were the ones that were not giving us freedom of choice, and compared blockchain with the carnations in the 25th of April of 1974 Portuguese revolution, where instead of using bullets to fight the oppressor regime, we put flowers in the tip of the army's guns.<br>\nBlockchain will give us freedom of choice, freedom of doing what we want and not having to ask for permission.<br>\nGraham is the CEO of  <a href=\"http://operaincubator.com/\">Opera Incubator</a>, based in Ireland. Mainly addressed <a href=\"http://festy.ie/\">festy</a>, a new way of paying in closed places, such as festivals or events.<br>\nThis is the beginning of cryptocurrencies payments, and festy will disrupt part of the status quo.</p>\n<p>I hope I can work with any of these guy in the future. Until then, I can only assure myself that I will keep working!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to Justin Wu and the organization.</p>\n<p>For reference, I'll just leave here the most important concepts, companies and techs that all these wonderful speakers mentioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://etherify.io/\">Etherify</a></li>\n<li><a
