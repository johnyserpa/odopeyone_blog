This means having a worldwide cross-borders \\\"single source of trust\\\" where all the processes of whichever business can talk to and trust its information. It was also grasped why the big tech players, such as [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/), are into R&D and counseling blockchain business integrations, because they will facilitate any kind of business to integrate a blockchain just as they made it possible to any business have a pay-as-you-go cloud infrastructure.\\nThey are the state-of-the-art guys, and they will make money helping others developing this tech.\\n\\n![Twitter by @futurebehind](/content/images/2017/11/DOgiqBXXkAIpAxM.jpg)*from @futurebehind twitter*\\n\\n[Fernando Gutierrez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandogutierrez/) from DASH core team was also there and showed us, or at least me, that Bitcoin is probably the MVP of cryptocurrencies, letting [DASH](https://www.dash.org/) lead for the best crypto in ease of use for programmers and non-tech users and distributing the incentives way better through the network. \\nHe also mentioned three things I hadn't heard of: \\n* [Masternodes](https://www.dash.org/masternodes2/), that need to have 1000DASH as collateral and facilitate features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend, that are what the name says they are;\\n* [DAPI](https://cointelegraph.com/news/worlds-first-dapi-decentralized-application-programming-interface), which is a decentralized API that facilitates other applications querying the blockchain without having to go directly to it, but talking with a subset, randomly picked, of masternodes in which they know, mathematically, they can trust.\\n* [DASH DRIVE](https://github.com/dashpay/dash-roadmap), which lets you save and query decentralized user object data, outside the blockchain. It is using the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System Protocol) that gives content addresses to data, instead of location addresses.\\n\\n> \\\"Don't rely on government to protect you. On Internet and Blockchain, you are alone.\\\" - Fernando Gutierrez\\n\\nFernando participated in the next forum, regarding the legalization of Blockchain, and what I really enjoyed he said was \\\"Don't rely on government to protect you. In Internet and Blockchain, you are alone.\\\", just like in life, you are born and die alone, just you.\\nDon't get that normal feeling that government will always (or never) have your back because this is a very difficult to regulate and keep track of technology. Governments are always a step behind the markets, never the other way around.\\n\\nI think it will be inevitable that governments unleash the markets. Another way, it will always be a cat and dog run. Long live guys like Henry Thoreau that knew this from the beginning.\\n\\n![Twitter by @futurebehind](/content/images/2017/11/DOn0r-dW4AA6Shc.jpg)*from @futurebehind twitter*\\n\\nAnother interesting topic was ICO's and the speakers, [Denis Suslov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denissuslov/), [Paulo Rodrigo Trezentos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulotrezentos/) and [Nuno Correia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nuno-correia-659175151/), gave their advice on how to spot a good or bad ICO:\\n* Do they have a team responsible for legal terms?\\n* Which role does the token play in the project?\\n* Read the white paper (protocol) and the crowd sale document (roadmap) carefully!\\n\\nChoose wisely, as more than 90% of them don't even take off.\\nImportant to mention that despite all the unregulated gray area that lays around ICO's and cryptocurrencies, they advised not to fear it, to follow the existing rules, like hiring through the normal system, and most important, **pay taxes**. That's what governments want - if you do it, most of the times you'll be fine.\\n\\n> \\\"Keep complexity off-chain. Only validate it in-chain\\\" - Gonçalo Sá\\n\\n[Gonçalo Sá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnsps/) gave a talk about the power of smart contracts. \\nWhile talking about [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), he mentioned that it was an ultra-complex pile of code all bundled together, comparing it with the **ethereum mindset of smart contracts, making them the smallest unit in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization**. That's evolution, breaking down a pile of code into its atomic units.\\nAnother important remark was the fact that smart contracts should not be complex, but rather simple pieces of code that validate the external complex code. \\n\\n[Anderson Mccutheon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ender/) talked about the decentralized web and attention span.\\nHe spoke about the concept of content and attention monetization as all companies are fighting for it as their core income source. More attention equals more user data that can be sold.

to deploy Angular and nodeJS express app in Heroku","slug":"how-to-deploy-angular-and-nodejs-express-app","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"![expressplusangular-2](/content/images/2017/11/expressplusangular-2.png)\\nMy main problem was to understand how could I bundle together a client-server app with **[angular](https://angular.io/)** and **[express](https://expressjs.com/)** frameworks.\\n> I started by deploying two different apps, but after all, understood how all of this could be done in one app only.\\n## Requirements\\n* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)\\n* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\\n* [git](https://git-scm.com/)\\n* [heroku-cli](https://heroku.com)\\n## Create app\\nJust start an express app as you usually do it, i user [express-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator) installed globally:\\n\\n`$ express example-app`\\n`$ cd example-app`\\n`$ npm install`\\n`$ git init`\\n# Heroku create app\\n[Heroku getting-started docs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction) are a very good resource, feel free to follow it as I will go very fast on it. \\n\\nFirst of all, you should log in with the heroku-cli, so that heroku know who you are: `$ heroku login`\\nAfter, you should create an heroku app in their servers and associated with your account: `$ heroku crate example-app`\\n\\nHeroku will give you two links:\\nWeb URL: `https://example-app.herokuapp.com/`\\nand a GIT repository: `https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git`\\n\\nNow you need to set the remote repository like that **git url** you got:\\n`$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git`\\n\\nYou are ready to go!\\n## Angular inside express\\nHaving an express app, you can generate an angular app, separated or already inside of it.\\n\\nI did it separately, and that's how I'm going to explain it.\\n\\nMy project structure was like this:\\n```\\napp\\\\\\n    client\\\\ (angular)\\n    server\\\\ (express)\\n```\\n    \\nAnd in the end it looked like this:\\n```\\napp\\\\ (express)\\n    package.json\\n    bin\\\\\\n    node_modules\\\\\\n    views\\\\\\n    ...\\n    public\\\\ (angular inside)\\n```\\n        \\n**In essence, angular is the static files served by the express app.**\\n\\n# Tweaks needed\\nI will be assuming your angular app is building to a dist folder, with it's path as `app/public/dist`.\\n* Add all angular package.json dependencies to **express** package.json\\n* Change, in `app.js` the path to the static folder:\\n`app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public/dist')));`\\n* angular-cli.json:\\n    * Tell where anfular app is:\\n        ```\\n        \\\"root\\\": \\\"public/src\\\",\\n        \\\"outDir\\\": \\\"public/dist\\\",\\n        ```\\n    * Tell it, relatively, also, where **schema, scripts and styles** are (I just added \\\"../\\\" before \\\"node_modules\\\" as angular needs to get them from the express' node_modules folder):\\n        ```\\n        \\\"$schema\\\": \\\"../../node_modules/@angular/cli/lib/config/schema.json\\\"\\n        ...\\n        \\\"styles\\\": [\\n            \\\"../../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\\\",\\n            \\\"styles.css\\\"\\n          ],\\n          \\\"scripts\\\": [\\n            \\\"../../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\\\",\\n            \\\"../../node_modules/tether/dist/js/tether.min.js\\\",  \\n            \\\"../../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js\\\"\\n          ]\\n          ```\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nAfter all, it seems pretty simple, but I didn't find any resource that explained
